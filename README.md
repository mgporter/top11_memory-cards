Odin Project project from https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card

1. automatic font scaling to make sure name fits within space

2. random card data pulled from an api, so different everytime

3. First react app!

4. uses useState and useEffect hooks to manage rendering. Eg timer, adding/removing cards/ shuffling card order

5. Shuffling animation uses Javascript to calculate movements. Works no matter the screen size, zoom level, number of cards displayed, or arrangement of cards
